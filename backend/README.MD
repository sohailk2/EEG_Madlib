# This is the backend of the madlib application
### It really only has one purpose:
* Recieve an input image -> return back the word from that input image

multiple ways to do this
actually set up the file upload system. might be slow bc lots of data?
just predownload all the data for the associated word into a folder in the backend and the react app will just send an image_id in and the backend knows what to return based on that
